Create and use virtual environments: Virtual environments are isolated environments for Python that allow you to install packages locally for a specific project, without affecting the global installation of Python packages. To create a virtual environment, you can use the virtualenv package, which can be installed using the following command: \n",

        "Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web-based application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter Notebook is a popular tool for data analysis and scientific computing, as it provides an interactive and intuitive environment for working with data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the steps to use Jupyter Notebook:\n",
        "\n",
        "Install Jupyter Notebook: To install Jupyter Notebook, you can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt: `pip install jupyter`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Start Jupyter Notebook: To start Jupyter Notebook, you can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt: `jupyter notebook`. This will open a web browser showing the Jupyter Notebook dashboard, where you can navigate to the directory where you want to create your notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "Create a new notebook: To create a new notebook, click the \"New\" button on the Jupyter Notebook dashboard, and select \"Python 3\" from the dropdown menu. This will create a new notebook with a single code cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "Enter code in a cell: You can enter code in a code cell by clicking in the cell and typing. You can then run the code in the cell by pressing Shift + Enter or by clicking the \"Run\" button in the toolbar.\n",
        "\n",
        "Add a new cell: To add a new cell, you can click the \"Insert\" button in the toolbar, or use the keyboard shortcut b to create a new cell below the current cell, or a to create a new cell above the current cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "Change cell type: To change the type of a cell from code to markdown (for narrative text), or vice versa, you can select the cell and click the dropdown menu in the toolbar that says \"Code\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Save your notebook: To save your notebook, you can click the \"Save\" button in the toolbar, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + s (or Cmd + s on macOS).\n",
        "\n",
        "Download your notebook: To download your notebook, you can click the \"Download\" button in the toolbar and select the format you want to download it in, such as .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook file format), .py (Python script), or .pdf (Portable Document Format).\n",
        "\n",
        "By using these steps, you can quickly get started with Jupyter Notebook and start exploring and analyzing data in an interactive and intuitive environment."
