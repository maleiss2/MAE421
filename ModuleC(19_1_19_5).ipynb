        "Root-finding problem refers to the mathematical task of finding a numerical solution (known as a root) of an equation f(x) = 0, where f is a given function and x is an unknown variable. The goal is to determine a value of x such that when substituted into the equation, the left-hand side equals the right-hand side. This type of problem arises in various fields including mathematics, science, engineering, and finance. Here is an example of a root-finding algorithm implemented in Python using the bisection method:"

A smaller tolerance results in a more accurate solution but may also require more computationally expensive calculations."
